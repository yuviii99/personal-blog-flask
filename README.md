# Personal Blog

A complete ready to deploy blog website developed using Flask with Python and flask libraries such as Flask-WTF, Flask Login.

I used SQLite for database with the help of SQLAlchemy.

This application provides the user to create a new post, edit or delete an old one (Currently restricted to admin, you can change if you want!)

All the posts are fetched from SQLite database using SQLAlchemy and rendered on the home page.
